# Frequently Asked Questions

## Which wallets are currently supported?

MetaMask is currently supported, and other wallets will be supported in the future.  

## If I have a domain name, can I create a subdomain name?

Yes, if you have a domain name, you can create multiple subdomains below.  Unlike ENS, however, assigning ownership of these subdomains to others is not supported.  Imagine the DNS of the Internet, where users can create subdomains but obviously cannot assign ownership to others or create domain name registries.  

## Can I register a top-level domain name?

No.  Top-level domain names can only be created by smart contract owners.  

## How much do you charge for domain name registration?

Users need to charge a fee to register a domain name, including registration fee and lease fee.  

* Registration fees are based on the length of the domain name and are charged only at the time of registration.  The shorter the domain, the higher the cost.  
  * Currently, The registration fee is 1000ETH for a domain name of length 1
  * Currently, The registration fee is 100ETH for a domain name of length 2
  * Currently, The registration fee is 1ETH for a domain name of length 3
  * Currently, The registration fee is 0 for a domain name greater than 3 in length
  
* Renewal will not be charged.  Rental fees are charged according to the length of time.  The shorter the domain, the higher the cost.  
  * Currently, a domain name of 1 length costs 1ETH per year
  * Currently, a domain name of 2 length costs 1ETH per year
  * Currently, a domain name of 3 length costs 0.1ETH per year  
  * Currently, a domain name of 4 length costs 0.01ETH per year
  * Currently, a domain name larger than 4 in length costs 0.001ETH per year

If a domain name expires, you need to register it again. However, the domain name may be registered before the expiration date. Therefore, you need to renew the domain name before the expiration date.  

There is no additional charge for users to add subdomains.
