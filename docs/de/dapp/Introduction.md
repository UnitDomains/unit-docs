# Introduction to Dapp Development

In Dapp, related libraries can be easily used to support UnitDomains domain names, including domain name resolution and reverse resolution.

## DNS

For users, domain names are easy to remember and not easy to get wrong. In the case of transfer, login, etc., after the user enters the domain name, it is easy to check whether the input is correct, and the Dapp should resolve the domain name to the relevant ETH address.

## Domain name reverse resolution

In Dapp, displaying the domain name corresponding to the user's ETH address makes it easier for the user to understand and identify the account and avoid mistakes.
