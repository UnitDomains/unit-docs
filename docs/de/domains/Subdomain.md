# Subdomain

The controller of the domain name can create any number of sub-domains under the domain name, and sub-domain names can be created under the sub-domain name. Each domain name is separated by a decimal point.

When creating a subdomain, the registration center will not charge registration fees and rental fees, but users need to pay relevant miner fees (GAS fees).
