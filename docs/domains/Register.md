# Domain registration

Similar to ENS, domain registration requires three steps: request registration, wait a minute, and register.

## request registration

Send a request to the registry to register a domain name.

## wait a minute

Wait a while to make sure you don't conflict with other people's requests.

## register

After completing the registration and paying the registration fee and rental fee, add the registration information in the registration center.
