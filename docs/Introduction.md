# Introduction

In the Internet, DNS (Domain Name System) is a very important service, which realizes the conversion of domain names in the form of strings that are easy to read and write into IP addresses, and facilitates people to access the Internet.

In the Web3 era, the address on Ethereum is an address similar to 0xc0dfe2234779296a45a3884636ACdE1cF9f54978, etc. BTC, LTC and other addresses are similar. Obviously, such addresses are not easy to read and write for humans, which requires a domain name system similar to DNS to convert domain names in the form of strings into ETH addresses. At present, there are several such domain name systems, the most famous is ENS (https://ens.domains/).

Unit Domains is a distributed, open and scalable Web3 domain name service system based on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contracts and website of Unit Domains both refer to and borrow from the ENS (https://ens.domains/) system.

Similar to ENS, the main goal of Unit Domains is to resolve human-readable and writable domain names (such as test.cat) into addresses that can be recognized by computers or Web3, such as Ethereum addresses, metadata, etc.

Similar to the DNS of the traditional Internet, Unit Domains is a hierarchical domain name system. Top-level domain names include .cat, .dag, .unit, etc. Users can create sub-domain names, such as test.cat, and continue to create the following sub-domains Domain name, such as a.test.cat, etc. Domain names between different levels are separated by decimal points.

The data of the domain name is stored on the Ethereum chain, and the management is carried out through smart contracts.
